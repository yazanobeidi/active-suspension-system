# active-suspension-system
An active vehicular suspension control system using a PID controller designed from first principles

I did this project in 3rd year (Spring of 2017) for our Controls class.

I built a quarter-car model of the suspension system and wheel, modeled it as a plant function, implemented it in MATLAB, and then manually determined PID values that resulted in a comfortable ride across different road types.
